> Note: Completed this task within 2 days. I had office previous 3 days.

> Another Note: I learnt vue, typescript within the 1st day and implemented most of the project within the 2nd day.

This is a Typescript project using VueJS. Majority of the code is done in Typescript. Run the following code to see if node.js is installed: 

```bash
node --version
```
If node.js is not installed, first install it. Then continue with the following code:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This should start the server at http://localhost:8080.

Some ScreenShots of the project:
