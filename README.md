This is a Typescript project using VueJS. Majority of the code is done in Typescript. Run the following code to see if node.js is installed: 

```bash
node --version
```
If node.js is not installed, first install it. Then continue with the following code:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This should start the server at http://localhost:8080.
